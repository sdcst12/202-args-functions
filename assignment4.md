Reflection on statistics.
We have seen 4 measurements of central tendency (the *average*): mean, median, mode and midpoint.

Do you think one of them is a better measure of central tendency (finding an *average*) than the others?  There are several resources to help you answer this question that can be accessed with a google search on the Internet.

Your assignment is to 
1. Find an article appropriate to your level of understanding that helps you decide if one method is better than the others
2. Think about and describe situations where one measure would be more appropriate/useful than another.
3. Write a paragraph here that discusses your answer.
